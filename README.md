*I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Advancements.*

*With over 2+ years of hands-on experience in leading industry projects, I do possess a strong foundation in Mathematics & Statistics, and high competency in Predictive Modeling, Complex Data Processing & Algorithm Development. And I'm ardent to solve real-world problems.*

*The journey started with curiosity. So I began to acquire core knowledge to understand the true potential of AI.
Exploring further by pursuing Master's in AI from IIIT & Liverpool John Moore's University. Furthermore, I have done innumerable research from various sources and completed multiple certifications programs.*

***Yet, the passion grows with the aim of lifelong learning towards shaping the future!***
